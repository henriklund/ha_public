# electricity.jinja
This macro can, based on sensors with known energy prices, calculate when, within a given timeframe, the
cheapest /most expensive period will occur 

## Basic use
The makro can be called adding just the mySensor_today parameter. Any missing parameter will have a default
value. Paramaters can be added in any order providing their parameter name is used. If parametername is omitted,
the correct order of parameters is required to ensure correct parsing. E.g.:<br/>
  {{- PeriodPrice("sensor.edssensor", duration=timedelta(minutes=90)) -}} 

## Parameters
Required = *

| * mySensor_today       |(dict / String) Name of the sensor that contain pricing data for today.|
| mySensor_tomorrow      |(dict / string) Name of the sensor that contains pricing data for tomorrow.<br/>Note that if mySensor_today is a string, this sensor will default to mySensor_today, otherwise it will default to dict()|
| mySensor_forecast      |(dict / string) Name of the sensor that contains pricing data for forecast.<br/>Note that if mySensor_today is a string, this sensor will default to mySensor_today, otherwise it will default to dict()|

### mySensor_xxxxxx
Possible value formats (* indicates optional):
- "entity_id""
- dict(data:[], *timeTag="string", *priceTag="string)

A value of "" or dict() is used to indicate 'empty value' and means that this particular sensor and subsequent sensor(s) data will be ignored. The sensors order is mySensor_today -> mySensor_tomorrow -> mySensor_forecast.
If "entity_id" format is used, it is assumed that the sensor has an attribute that (dependent on the _mySensor_xxxxxx_ addressed) will be either _raw_today_, _raw_tomorrow_ or _forecast_. If this is not the case for the sensor, use the dict instead.<br/>
In the dict, the data must be formatted as a list of pairs, i.e. [{key_date=date1, key_price=price1}, {key_date=date2, key_price=price2}, ...]. If timeTag and price are omitted, macro attempts to see of the default values (_timeTag = start_ and _priceTag = price_) work. If that fails it will attemtp to identify suitable candites for the key names:<br/>
- A value will be identified as a date, if it is a datetime (number, string or datetime object) and is either not a number or a number that translate larger than 99999999 (a date in 1973). The corresponding key will used as timeTag for the lowest value found.
- A value will be identified as a number, if it either _is_ a number or if int filter return something usable. ( X |int(1) - X int(2) ) is a check that will ensure this since an invalid value will return default and thus never result in the final result being zero :)

### earliestDatetime / latestDatetime
A datatime object may be provided for start / end of the window during which cheapest / most expensive price is calculated. _earliestDatetime_ will default to _now()_ if omitted. _latestDatetime_ will be set to _earliestDatetime_ + _defaultPeriodHrsNum_ (24) hours if omitted. Furthermore, see _timeAdherence_ for how that will affect _earliestDatetime_ / _latestDatetime_.

### duration
Possible value formats:
- number
- timedelta()

If a timedelta formatted value is provided, duration is rounded to whole minutes.

### timeAdherence
**default**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adjusts time to 'now' if time is in the past (default value)<br/>
**strict**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not adjust time (start / end) and return empty result if window is in the past<br/>
**forced**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not adjust time (start / end) and return result even if window is in the past

### mode
Defines what is returned by the macro (default being, well the default). Note that all data returned will be formatted as a string.<br/>
default / details returns a json (see below under **Returns**. _details_ will contain same data as default + explain information + priceWindow + usageWindow./<br/>
cheapPrice / cheapStart / expensiveStart / isCheapNow / expensivePrice / expensiveStart / expensiveStart / isExpensiveNow will return a single string containing the requested value (suited for use in a Helper Template Sensor).

### Hint
String to be returned as part of the result. This could (e.g.) be the name of the integration providing data. If _mySensor_xxxxxx_ is an entity_id, hint will return the friendly name if omitted.

### kwh_usage / usageWindow
Possible value formats:
- number
- []

If only one number is provided, this is assumed to be be total consumption and will be distributed evenly across duration.<br/>
If a list [] is provided, the consumption for that particular period of time (defined by the _usageWindow_), or timeslice, will be the kWh listed. See further below under **Slicing / kwh_usage**

### validateData
validateData will permit checking of the data provided by _mySensor_xxxxxx_. A valid check means that all dates in today / tomorrow / forecast is spaced at the same intervals, and that the intervals between today -> tomorrow and tomorrow -> forecast are also spaced at this interval<br/>
**ignore**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not validate data (default)<br/>
**prune**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;check for error, stop at first and keep data until this point<br/>
**stopOnError**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;check for error, stop at first and stop further processing
 
## Returns
Macro returns a STRING(!) based on the MODE setting. In case of a mode of default or details, the returned string will
be json formatted and must be converted using the _from_json_ filter.

When mode is default or details, the returned value (passed throught the from_json filter may contain following fields:

"*" = only included if a corresponding period was found
| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| cheap / expensive          | JSON containing information relating to cheapest / most expensive period. Each contain:<br/>* **startTime**: Datetime string of when time starts<br/>* **endTime**: Datetime string of when time ends<br/>**price**: Price if 1 (or the under kwh_usage mentioned) kWh is used for the duration. None if no period found<br/>**isCheapNow**/**isExpensiveNow**: none if no cheap/expensive time period found, otherwise true / false dependent on whether right now is the cheapest/most expensive period |
| window                     | JSON containing information relating to used window:<br/>**earliestDatetime**: Datetime string of the earliest time used when looking for cheap / expensive<br/>**latestDatetime**: Datetime string of the latest time used when looking for cheap / expensive<br/>**duration**: The duration of the time window looked for (in minutes) |
| mode                       | Name of the mode used |
| status                     | Result of the operation. If not 'ok', then this is an warning / error |
| hint                       | none or string as provided when  macro was called |

If mode is details, follwing data will also be available under the relevant JSONs
| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| explain                    | <ins>Under cheap/expensive JSON</ins><br/>Explaination for calculation to reach price.<br/>Set of [{ start, minutes, kWh_price, est_kWh },...] covering the whole duration. Start defines when each subset starts, length in minutes of the subset, kWh_price is the corresponding price and est_kWh is the kWh part of the corresponding slice. kWh_price * est_kWh is the estimated cost for the slice.|
|validate                    | <ins>Under window JSON</ins><br/>JSON with following possible fields:<br/>**validationMode** = Lower case version of _validateData_<br/>**check**          = Status of last validation<br/>**kept**           = Number of kept records<br/>**lastGood**       = Last good record<br/>**invalid**        = First bad record
<br/>
<br/>
For any other mode, the returned value will be a string with the following content:

| Mode      | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
|cheapPrice     | String value of price if 1 kW is used each hour during cheapest time. If kwh_usage is supplied, the amount of kWh is calculated from this. None if no period found |
|cheapStart     | Datetime string of when cheapest time starts |
|cheapEnd       | Datetime string of when cheapest time ends |
|expensivePrice | String value of price if 1 kW is used each hour during most expensive time. If kwh_usage are supplied, the amount of kWh is calculated from this. None if no period found |
|expensiveStart | Datetime string of when most expensive time starts |
|expensiveEnd   | Datetime string of when most expensive time ends |

## Advanced use
### Multiple sensors
The macro has the ability to get day-ahead pricing for today / tomorrow from two sensors. I.e. sensor1 can provide todays pricing, and sensor2 can provide tomorrows; e.g. this could be the case when using [Str√∏mligning](https://github.com/MTrab/stromligning). If forecast data is available (e.g. you have a sensor that pulls data from [Carnots API](https://www.carnot.dk/), then this data can also be used. However, there are some requirements that must be met:
- Data obtained from these (up to) three sensors may not overlap
- The prices are valid for the same duration (e.g. hour)
- The name (entity_id) of the sensor must be listed in mySensor_today / mySensor_tomorrow / mySensor_forecast. Note:
  - if mySensor_forecast is set to empty, forecast data is ignored
  - if mySensor_tomorrow is set to empty, both data for tomorrow as well as forecast are ignored
  - Default value of mySensor_tomorrow / mySensor_forecast is the value of mySensor_today
- In the entity, an attribute is expected named attr_today_arr / attr_tomorow_arr / attr_forecast_arr. The attribute must exist in the corresponding mySensor_today / mySensor_tomorrow / mySensor_forecast
- Each of the attributes must contain pairs named alike. The default names are 'hour' and 'price' and can be overridden using the parameters timeTagStr and priceTagStr

### Search mode
timeAdherenceStr controls how the macro uses earliestDatetime / latestDatetime. 
- If timeAdherenceStr is ommitted or set to 'default', the macro will adjust earliestDatetime / latestDatetime to match a earliestDatetime equal to <ins>now</ins>.
- If set to strict, the earliestDatetime / latestDatetime will not be adjusted. If matching time window is found, the information will only be returned if this is in the present. Otherwise an empty set is returned.
- If set to forced, the earliestDatetime / latestDatetime will not be adjusted. Information will be returned irrespectively of this being in the past or present.

### Data returned
returnFirstBool will define (if true) to return the earliest possible match. If false, the latest match will be returned.

### Prices
By default the macro will detect for how long the prices are valid. This is done by taking the time difference of two first prices found. Should only one price be found, 1 hour is assumed. This allows for a 
later adjustment in the pricing mode (e.g. pricing per half hour instead of hourly) without having to change the macro.

### Slicing / kwh_usage
If data is available on how much power (normally) is expected consumed, kwh_usage can be added when calling the macro. To allow some variation, an hour is divided into smaller parts (slices). Each part of the kwh_usage list is
attributed to a slice, and is only used once during a calculation. If a number is provided instead of a list, the number is assumed to be the total consumption and will be distributed evenly across the duration.<br/>
The usageWindow must be a whole number between 1 and 60 minutes. This duration is applied to each of the slices listed in kwh_usage. If the total usageWindow for all slices is less than the duration time, an error will be returned. If kwh_usage is a number instead of a list, the macro will create its own kwh_usage list and spread the provided kWh evenly across the duration (considering the usageWindow requested). If kwh_usage is empty, **an hourly usage of 1 kWh is assumed**. If no usageWindow is provided, a window of 60 minutes is assumed; the usageWindow is not coupled to the priceWindow allowing maximum freedom to define each of these.
| usageWincow | kwh_usage | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| included (1-60) | number | _duration_ is interrnally split into small slices with the same length as _usage_window_ and _kwh_usage_ is split equally amongst these slices|
| included (1-60) | list   | If _usageWindow_ multiplied by length of _kwh_usage_ does not exceed duration, an error is raised|
| included (1-60) | not included | If _usageWindow_ multiplied by length of _kwh_usage_ does not exceed duration, an error is raised. Hourly usage is assumed to be one 1kWh|
| not included | list   | If _usageWindow_ multiplied by default length of _kwh_usage_ (60 mins) does not exceed duration, an error is raised|
| not included | number | _kwh_usage_ is assumed evenly distributed across _duration_. An internal split of _kwh_usage_ is created based on the default length of _usageWindow_|
| not included | not included | An hourly sage of one 1kWh is assumed |

**Note:**<br/>
- For each hour there are up to three points upon calculation is based; first minute of the hour, the current minute and the last minute that is (duration % hour) before the hour. The majority of iterations will have 2 or (on rare occassions) 1 data points. If a low usageWindow is applied (eg. 5), this means that if seeking a one hour window, there for every 24 hrs will up to 48 * (12+2 - the 2 is for the outliers) * 12 = 8.064 calculations to be done to find the lowest / highest price. Extending the period from 2 days (today + tomorrow) to also include a 7 days forecast means that every time a sensor needs to be updated, +72.576 calculations are made. Thus, it is important to consider how small a usageWindow is needed when extending the lastDatetime beyond 48 hours as well how long a period of cheap / expensive price should be looked for. Remember to also take the type of hardware on which Home Assistant is running into account. If in doubt, test the configuration in _Template_ under _Developer tools_ by addion a _**{%- from 'Electricity.jinja' import PeriodPrice -%}**_ in front of the code (see examples below) to get an impression of how the macro performs.
- If duration is one hour or less, slicing will provide little if any beenfit. If duration is low (typically 2 hours or less), there _can_ be a gain by applying a _usageWindow_ and a _kwh_usage_, however, often adjacent price windows will have a difference in pricing so low that the potential saving can be measured in a few cents. Exception from this is for price windows that span low -> high prive ande vice versa. Dependent on where is the usage cycle power is consumed, viable windows may be returned that otherwise could have been rejected. E.g. a window with 50 cent / kWh windows is followed by a 150 cent / kWh window. If duration is 2 hours and consumed power if 4 kWH, this would normally be considered a bad choice since the estimated price would be 400 cents for the duration. However, if measurenments showed that 80% of power was consumed within the first 60 mins, the estimated price would change to 280.<br/>For longer duration, and especially where the consumed power varies to a considerable degree over time, benefits may be seen from using _usageWindow_ and a _kwh_usage_.

## Frequently asked questions
1. **_Can I use the macro in a Template Helper?_**<br/>
   Yes. A good choice is the Template Senor and then use one of the code examples above as a guideline. Remember to add a mode (e.g. _mode="cheapStart"_) to the call of PeriodPrice macro. Currently states are limited to 256 characters so forgetting this part will result in an error. Further remember to omit filtering (_| from_json_) from the returned result. While Home Assistant may ignore such a filter, the data returned is <ins>not</ins> json formatted and thus an error may arise at a later stage should the Home Assistant developers decide to enforce a stricter syntax.
1. **_I keep getting noWindowFound_**
  Check following
    - If _mySensor_xxxxxx_ contains the string that is the actual name of the sensor, does the sensor have a _raw_today_ / _raw_tomorrow_ / _forecast attribute_? If so, does each of these consist of pair with _hour_ and _price_? If the answer is no to either of these, you will have to use a dict in the following format: _dict(data=state_attr(sensor, attribute), timeTag="tag_str", priceTag="price_str")_
    - If mySensor_xxxxxx is a dict, please check for proper formatting and naming. Cross check with the actual sensor (using Developer Tools -> States in Home Assistant).
    - Has _latestDatetime_ been passed when using _mode=strict_? If so, either change _latestDatetime_ or change _mode_ to a different setting
    - Are the sensors missing day-ahead for tomorrow, and is time so close to midnight that duration is longer than time until midnight? If so, either decrease duration or see attempt to rectify the missing day-ahead information


# day-ahead_fallback.snip
Template for a sensor to be added to configuration.yaml. Sensor will allow fallback between the Home Assistant integrations Energi Data Service -> Str√∏mligning -> Nordpool in case the day-ahead prices are not updated. Please note that there is no validation of the suitability of the data from each integration (that is the responisibility of the integration) nor is there any handling of missing information (i.e. forecast info when using Str√∏migning / Nordpool or tarifs when using Nordpool).<br/>
The template can be extended with other integrations if so needed.
